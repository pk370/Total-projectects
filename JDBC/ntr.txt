He gained popularity in the 1950s when he became well known for his portrayals of Hindu deities, especially Krishna, Shiva and Rama,[8] roles which have made him a "messiah of the masses", and a prominent figure in the history of cinema.[8][9] He later became known for portraying antagonistic characters and Robin Hood-esque hero characters in films.[10][11][12][13] N. T. R. was voted "Greatest Indian Actor of All Time" in a CNN-IBN national poll conducted in 2013 on the occasion of the Centenary of Indian Cinema.[14][15][16]

Early life
Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao was born in a Hindu agrarian family on 28 May 1923[1] in Nimmakuru, a small village in Gudivada taluk of Krishna district, which was a part of the erstwhile Madras Presidency of British India. He was given in adoption to his paternal uncle because his uncle and aunt were childless.[25] He was first educated by a teacher who came from a nearby village, whom he would attribute his command of Telugu to, as well as his father, an aspiring thespian and patron of the arts.[26] Although children were normally pulled out of school after completing their primary education, on account of being the first male child in the family, his father sent him to Vijayawada, where he continued his education, matriculating in 1940 before studying at SRR & CVR College and at the Andhra Christian College in Guntur.[27] In 1947, he joined the Madras Service Commission as a sub-registrar at Prathipadu of Guntur district, a much-coveted job that he nevertheless quit within three weeks to devote himself to acting.[28] He developed a baritone singing voice as a young man.[8]

Personal life
In May 1943, at the age of 20, while still pursuing his Intermediate, Rao was married to Smt. Basava Rama Tarakam, the daughter of his maternal uncle. The marriage resulted in twelve children; including eight sons and four daughters, namely: Ramakrishna Sr., Jayakrishna, Saikrishna, Harikrishna, Mohanakrishna, Balakrishna, Ramakrishna Jr., Jayashankarakrishna, Garapati Lokeswari (daughter), Daggubati Purandeswari (daughter), Nara Bhuvaneswari (daughter), and Kantamaneni Umamaheswari (daughter).[29]

Smt. Basava Tarakam died of cancer[30] in 1985. In her memory, Rao established the Basavatarakam Indo-American Cancer Hospital in Hyderabad in 1986.[31] In 1993, NTR married Lakshmi Parvathi, a Telugu writer.[32] The marriage was childless and lasted until NTR's death less than three years later. Parvati was the author of NTR's two-volume biography published in 2004. The first volume, Eduruleni Manishi (transl. Unstoppable person), covers his childhood and his entry into films. The second volume, Telugu Tejam (transl. The radiance of Telugu), deals with his political career.[33][34]

NTR's eldest son, Nandamuri Ramakrishna Sr., died in 1962, 1944-1962 soon after Rao completed shooting of the film Irugu Porugu.[35] Rao founded the film studios Ramakrishna Studios in Nacharam in his memory. NTR's third son, Nandamuri Saikrishna, who was a theatre owner, died in 2004 following diabetic complications.[36] His fourth son, Nandamuri Harikrishna, who died in a car accident on 29 August 2018, was a child actor-turned-politician elected to the Rajya Sabha, representing the TDP. Harikrishna's sons Nandamuri Kalyan Ram and N. T. Rama Rao Jr. are also actors in the Telugu cinema.[37] NTR's sixth son, Nandamuri Balakrishna, has been one of the leading actors in Tollywood since the mid-1980s. He also started his career as a child artist. Balakrishna contested 2014 assembly elections as a TDP candidate.[38] He won the Hindupur Assembly Constituency. His seventh son, Nandamuri Ramakrishna Jr. is a film producer.

NTR's third daughter, Bhuvaneshwari, is the wife of former chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu. NTR's second daughter, Daggubati Purandeswari, is a widely respected politician, who has represented the Indian National Congress in the Lok Sabha and served as a Union Minister. She later shifted her allegiance to the Bharatiya Janata Party.[39][40] NTR's fourth and youngest daughter, Uma Maheswari, was found dead at her home in Hyderabad's Jubilee Hills on 1 August 2022. According to Police, her death appears to be an instance of suicide, but no suicide note was found.
